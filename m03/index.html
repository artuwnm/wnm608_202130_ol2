		<h2>CBD Benefits</h2>
		<div class="article-body">
			<p>Cannabidiol (CBD) is a popular natural remedy used for many common ailments. Unlike THC, CBD is not psychoactive. This quality makes CBD an appealing option for those who are looking for relief from pain and other symptoms without the mind-altering effects of marijuana or certain pharmaceutical drugs. CBD oil is made by extracting CBD from the cannabis plant, then diluting it with a carrier oil like coconut or hemp seed oil. It’s gaining momentum in the health and wellness world, with some scientific studies confirming it may ease symptoms of ailments like chronic pain and anxiety. There are many health benefits of CBD.</p>
			<p><strong>Pain Relief</strong>
			<br>Certain components of marijuana, including CBD, are responsible for its pain-relieving effects. The human body contains a specialized system called the endocannabinoid system (ECS), which is involved in regulating a variety of functions including sleep, appetite, pain and immune system response . The body produces endocannabinoids, which are neurotransmitters that bind to cannabinoid receptors in your nervous system. Some studies have found that a combination of CBD and THC is effective in treating pain related to multiple sclerosis and arthritis. </p>
			<p><strong>Anxiety and Depression</strong><br>Reduction Anxiety and depression are usually treated with pharmaceutical drugs, which can cause a number of side effects including drowsiness, agitation, insomnia, sexual dysfunction and headache. In additions, medications like benzodiazepines can be addictive and may lead to substance abuse. CBD oil has shown promise as a treatment for both depression and anxiety. CBD oil has even been used to safely treat insomnia and anxiety in children with post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
			<p><strong>Alleviates Cancer-Related Symptoms</strong><br>CBD may also help reduce chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting. Though there are drugs that help with these symptoms, they are sometimes ineffective, leading some people to seek alternatives. Some studies have even shown that CBD may have anticancer properties . It’s important to note these studies only suggest what might work in people. More studies are needed before conclusions can be made.</p>
			<p><strong>Help Neurological disorders</strong><br>
			One of the most successful studied uses for CBD is in treating neurological disorders like epilepsy and multiple sclerosis. Other studies have included the use of CBD in people with Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
			<p><strong>Heart Health Benefits</strong> 
			<br>Some research  has linked CBD with benefits for the heart and circulatory system, including the ability to lower high blood pressure. The stress- and anxiety-reducing properties of CBD are responsible for its ability to help lower blood pressure.</p>
