			<h2>HERITAGE</h2>
			<div class="article-body">
				<p>Mayfair is legendary: for precious jewels, antiques and works of art, fashion and the accessories of gracious living, its shops are unsurpassed anywhere in the world. Bentley & Co was first established in Bond Street in 1934. For over 50 years the company was under the sole direction of the present Director’s late uncle John Sheldon, a connoisseur of Russian descent whose magnificent collection of jewels created world-wide interest when sold through Sotheby’s in 1985.</p>
				<p>Skinner & Co was established in 1880 and had been in the same family for three generations. The Company was first invited to supply jewellery to the Royal Family in the latter years of Queen Victoria’s reign. Bentley & Skinner, Jewellers by Royal Appointment to both Her Majesty the Queen and His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales, buy and sell the loveliest jewellery. In September 2010 Bentley & Skinner relocated to splendid new premises at 55 Piccadilly, from where they continue in the tradition that has helped to make Mayfair a synonym for all that is excellent in the civilised world.</p>
				<p>Specialising in fine antique jewels, Faberge and silver, Bentley & Skinner are renowned for their unparalleled collection of engagement rings and for purchasing jewellery privately. The repair and re-modelling of jewellery is undertaken with the greatest care and attention to detail by expert craftsmen on their premises. The company is also at the forefront of modern jewellery design and innovative goldsmithing techniques, responsible for such unique works as the Damien Hirst diamond skull, For The Love Of God. As a family concern run by its Managing Director Mr Mark Evans, personal service has always been Bentley & Skinner’s hallmark and every enquiry is treated with courtesy and the utmost discretion.</p>
