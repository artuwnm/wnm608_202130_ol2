		<h2>Black Clothes Thrift Market</h2>

	<p>This store of all things black is an online thrift market selling gently used black clothing and shoes. I have an obsession with black fashion and 
always adding some fabulous new find to my wardrobe. The only problem is I tend to buy too many black items. In my attempt to unclutter my closet, I've selected some pieces to sell.Checkout these great deals.</p>
