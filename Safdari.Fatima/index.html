                    <h3>WORDS FROM OUR FOUNDER</h3>
                    <p>"As architects, we think about a project's relationship to its context.  In jewelry, I think about our body as the site for our pieces.  One of the first questions I think about when designing a new piece is how to find new and unique ways of addressing that context.  For example, the Mobius ring is one of our most inventive rings, in the way it drapes over the knuckle and allows your entire hand to balance the weight of ring.  It makes a large, statement ring feel effortless.</p>
                    <h3>THE JeWu PROCESS (THE MAKING)</h3>
                    <p>The design of every JeWu piece starts with a sketch. Each design is meticulously digitally crafted from its edge detailing to its intricate, interlocking assembly. We create modern, beautiful pieces that people actually want to wear-not just what is cool at the moment or what the technology can do. We think about jewelry as “architecture on the body,” and we carefully consider the relationship of each piece to our body and to each other. Most of our rings nest and stack in an unconventional way, and each one of our necklaces has an unique way of dressing our neckline.</p>
                    <h3>Learn more about 3D Printing Technologies & Materials in Jewelry</h3>
                    <h4>Technologies</h4>
                    <p>Since 2014, JeWu has been pioneering the use of 3D printing technology to produce unique, innovative jewelry pieces. JeWu has reinvented many of the traditional jewelry practices from design to its business model. We are constantly testing out new materials and experimenting with different design approaches. While we utilize high end 3D printing as our primary production method, we also produce rapid prototypes to test our designs and check its wearability using our 3D printers in the office. This allows the designers to make adjustments as they work through the prototyping phase while being able to see the results in a matter of hours. Final products are sent out to our trusted manufacturers to ensure that the latest technology and best materials are used.</p>
